# [PARITYTECH-ACTIONS](https://paritytech-actions.github.io/actions-marketplace/)
Hosts a GitHub Actions Marketplace for the [`paritytech`](https://github.com/paritytech) organization.

This repo will check all repositories in the organization it sits in and write a actions-data.json to a new branch `gh-pages`.
