# Actions-Marketplace
Hosts an Internal GitHub Actions Marketplace [PARITYTECH-ACTIONS](https://paritytech-actions.github.io/actions-marketplace/) for the [`paritytech`](https://github.com/paritytech) organization.

This repo will check all repositories in the organization it sits in and write a actions-data.json to a new branch `gh-pages`.

# Acknowledgement
This setup is based on a great work of [rajbos](https://github.com/rajbos) and forked from [rajbos/actions-marketplace](https://github.com/rajbos/actions-marketplace)
